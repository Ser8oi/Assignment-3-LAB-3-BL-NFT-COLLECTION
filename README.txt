Introduction
The NFTCollection smart contract is an Ethereum-based NFT (Non-Fungible Token) collection, designed to be a versatile foundation for various NFT use cases. It is built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity and leverages the power of OpenZeppelin libraries to ensure security and reliability. The contract provides a user-friendly, customizable, and extensible platform for minting and managing NFTs.

Functionality
NFT Minting
The contract allows the owner to mint NFTs, each representing a unique digital asset. The mintNFT function creates new NFTs and assigns them to addresses with specified metadata. The NFT supply is capped at 1000, ensuring rarity and exclusivity.
Metadata Management
You can upload metadata to IPFS or on-chain, and associate it with NFTs. Metadata can be replaced or updated, enhancing the flexibility of the NFT collection.
Testing
The contract includes a placeholder for writing tests using the Hardhat framework, enabling you to ensure the robustness of your smart contract.

Use Cases
The NFTCollection contract has vast potential usability, including:
•	Digital Art and Collectibles: Artists can showcase their digital creations, and collectors can own and trade unique pieces.
•	Virtual Real Estate: NFTs can represent ownership of virtual properties within a metaverse, allowing for buying and selling.
•	Gaming: NFTs can serve as rare in-game items, enhancing gameplay and creating a marketplace for gamers.
